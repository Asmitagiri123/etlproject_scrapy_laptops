# ETL Laptop Scraper Project

This project is an ETL pipeline for scraping laptop data from a website.  

**Steps in the project:**
1. **Extract**: Scraped laptop data (name, price, description, reviews) using Scrapy.  
2. **Transform**: Cleaned the data, like removing `$` from prices and stripping extra spaces.  
3. **Load**: Saved the cleaned data into a CSV file and inserted it into a MySQL database.
